# CelticsFrontOffice

My favorite NBA team is the Boston Celtics. In this module, I take the Franchise's [data](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/) and do statistical analysis

## Future Features
I hope to build this repo into adding my personal draft picks for the team, use data to prove that some trade moves would be better than others, and also do hypothesis tests.
A cleaner and better UI would be to render this data to a web application. That is something I plan to work towards. 


## Usage
Make sure you have Anaconda3 installed. Clone repo and initialize your notebook
